# Bank-loan-Analysis-PowerBi-Dashboard
      This project involves creating a bank loan analysis dashboard that visualizes loan amounts, customer trends, and key financial metrics. It enables users to    explore loan distributions by year, state, grade, and borrower status for better decision-making using interactive charts and filters.

## Question KPI
      1.What is the overall performance trend of the Total Loan Amount (currently 446M) over the visible years (2007-2011), as suggested by the Year Wise Loan    
      Amount graph.
      2.How does the Average Interest Rate (12.02%) compare to industry benchmarks or the bank's target rate?
      3.What is the Average DTI (Debt-to-Income ratio) (13.32) for the entire customer base, and how does this DTI level correlate with loan performance?
      4.Which loan purpose (e.g., debt_consolidation, credit_card) contributes the most to the Total Revolving Balance (531.5M)?
      5.What is the distribution of the Total Revolving Balance across the different loan grades and sub-grades (A, B, C, D, E, F)? Which grade holds the largest 
      revolving balance?
      6.How does the rate of Charged Off versus Fully Paid loans vary across the states shown in the State and Last_Credit chart?
      7.How does the Total Payment split between Verified and Not Verified customers affect the overall loan performance or default rates?
      8.What is the difference in Average Interest Rate between customers with RENT vs. MORTGAGE vs. OWN homeownership status?
      9.What is the total number of loans for the top 3 most common loan purposes (debt_consolidation, credit_card, home_improvement)?

## Process
      1. Data Preparation: Collect, clean, and transform raw loan data (customer info, financial metrics, loan status) to calculate the necessary KPIs (e.g.,                Average Interest Rate, DTI, Total Loan Amount).
      2. Dashboard Creation: Design and build the visualizations (graphs, charts, tables) using the calculated KPIs to present the loan portfolio's performance,             risk,and trends (as seen in your dashboard).
      3. Analyze the dashboard's visuals and filters (e.g., Year, Grade, Purpose) to identify risk areas (like high Charged Off rates in a specific state/grade)             and inform business decisions (e.g., adjusting lending policies or marketing efforts).

## Project Insights
       Growth: The portfolio is growing rapidly, with the Total Loan Amount increasing sharply from 2007 to 2011.
       Risk Profile: The biggest loan purpose is Debt Consolidation. Key risk states (CA, NY, TX) have the highest volumes of Charged Off loans.
       Customer Base: The bank is highly reliant on Not Verified customers, who account for nearly $\mathbf{59\%}$ of the total payments received.
       Credit Health: The overall portfolio has a manageable Average Interest Rate ($\mathbf{12.02\%}$) and Average DTI ($\mathbf{13.32}$).

## Final Conclusion:
       The Bank Loan Analysis dashboard reveals a story of rapid expansion coupled with unverified risk.The portfolio has experienced strong growth, evidenced by          the sharp increase in Total Loan Amount from 2007 to 2011. However, this growth is heavily concentrated in the potentially high-risk Debt Consolidation loan        purpose.The critical insight for management is the significant risk exposure driven by the reliance on Not Verified customers (accounting for 
       $\mathbf{58.88\%}$ of total payments) and the concentration of Charged Off loans in top-volume states like CA, NY, and TX.
       The overall portfolio appears solvent with a reasonable average DTI and interest rate, but the current structure suggests a need for risk-focused strategy          refinement to ensure sustainable, high-quality growth.
